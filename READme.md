# Services Interaction

This repository deals with the creation of Dockerized Microservices.

You will find two Django based services, serviceport8001 and serviceport8002. Change the names of the services in `docker-compose.yml `and you should be good to go by running the command `docker-compose up` in each terminal."# dockerized-services"
